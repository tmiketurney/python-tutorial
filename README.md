# python-tutorial
This repository contains python code I am using to sharpen my skills, following a Great Courses class.

With Class 13 the professor appears to be walking through some project design considerations with a program that will span multiple classes, a text-based grid game (think Candy Crush).

This branch will track the game design and implementation.
